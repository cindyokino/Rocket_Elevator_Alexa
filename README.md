# Rocket_Elevator_Alexa

At Rocket Elevators a new project has been funded to improve accessibility to information and artificial intelligence is seen as a tool to improve access to key functionality.

Alexa's functionality starts with a voice brief that allows an employee to inquire about the status of the elevator network deployed and operated by Rocket Elevators.

Hey Alexa, What is going on at Rocket Elevators?

The type of information that Alexa must present to her interlocutor includes the following:\
Greetings\
There are currently XXX elevators deployed in the XXX buildings of your XXX customers\
Currently, XXX elevators are not in Running Status and are being serviced\
XXX Batteries are deployed across XXX cities\
On another note you currently have XXX quotes awaiting processing\
You also have XXX leads in your contact requests\
